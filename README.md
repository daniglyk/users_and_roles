To deploy any of the "mini-projects" that exist here, follow these steps.

1. In the console, write the following command: "terraform init"
   So, you prepared a working draft (download the terraform working directory).

2. Then, enter the command: "terraform plan"
   So we can see what happens if we run this and make sure there are no errors.

3. Last - "terraform apply"
   Launch.
